To use the files here, you will need to create a new React Vite file and replace the files in the default one with the files in the commit. You will need to install Node.js and run npm create vite@latest. Select the React and Javascript + JWS then npm publish and npm run dev to run it. 
Might need to install nvm or npm too but I don't think so.
Be sure to install tailwind for the display to work correctly: [text](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)
Also I have a mobile version. Press ctrl-shift-i then in the inspect menu, press ctrl-shift-m to see mobile view
